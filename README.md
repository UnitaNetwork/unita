What is Unita?
-----------------

Unita is an enterprise blockchain system. It's featured of high TPS (Transactions Per Second) and low confirmation time, to make DApps (Decentralized Applications) applicable to more business scenarios. Meanwhile, by using a consensus algorithm named [SCAR](https://doc.unita.network/en/SCAR-Consensus/) (Scalable Consensus Algorithm), storage and network consumption are minimized, so as to reduce operating costs. It’s developed on the basis of [Qtum](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum) which is compatible with the Bitcoin UTXO data structure and Ethereum Solidity smart contracts.
